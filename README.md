====================

This is an optimizer for the game Letterpress

How to run:
===========
`python cheat_at_letterpress.py`

When it asks for the board, enter the letters starting in the upper left and
all concatenated together. End the board with a newline. Enter your letters and
your opponents letters in the same manner.
